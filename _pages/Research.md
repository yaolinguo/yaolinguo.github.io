Plant Ecology
</div>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 0;" />

I investigate how plant communities assemble and respond to environmental change by combining large‑scale field surveys with replicated common‑garden experiments. My work integrates plant functional traits, species interactions, and global climate change. Using network and Bayesian modeling, I test how trait covariation constrains or promotes adaptation, competition, and biological invasion, and I identify key traits that predict performance and ecosystem functions. This trait‑based approach provides mechanistic predictions of species’ responses to global change and informs evidence‑based restoration and management.

Biogeography and macroecology
</div>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 0;" />

I investigate the global distribution of plant functional traits and the networks of species interactions, and how both are reshaped by rapid climate change. Leveraging cross‑continental syntheses—trait and phylogenetic databases, interaction datasets, and remote sensing—together with hierarchical Bayesian and macroecological models, I quantify latitudinal and biome‑wide clines in traits (e.g., growth–defense strategies, palatability), link them to interaction outcomes (competition, facilitation, mutualism, herbivory), and identify the climatic and historical drivers behind these patterns. The aim is to deliver scalable, mechanistic predictions of where and how trait syndromes and interaction networks will reorganize under warming, sea‑level rise, and increasing extremes—supporting proactive conservation and restoration.

Biological invasions
</div>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 0;" />

I uncover the mechanisms that enable non‑native plants to establish, spread, and reshape ecosystems, with herbivory as a central driver of invasion success. By integrating field herbivore‑exclusion and feeding‑guild manipulations with replicated common‑garden assays and global syntheses of traits, interactions, and phylogeny, I quantify growth–defense trade‑offs, compensatory responses, and phenotypic plasticity across nutrient, disturbance, and climate gradients. Hierarchical Bayesian, network, and demographic models link herbivore pressure (guild, intensity, seasonality) to invader performance, competitive outcomes with natives, and ecosystem effects. Testing enemy release versus biotic resistance—and identifying cases of associational effects or apparent competition—reveals when consumers suppress invaders (biocontrol potential) or inadvertently facilitate them. The aim is to deliver predictive, mechanistic forecasts of invasion risk under warming and sea‑level rise that guide evidence‑based management and restoration.

Coastal wetland ecosystem
</div>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 0;" />

Coastal wetlands face urgent threats; I study how biological invasions—and herbivory as a key pathway—reshape ecosystem stability and resilience, and how targeted restoration can recover lost functions. I integrate long‑term monitoring with manipulative field experiments, common‑garden/mesocosm assays across salinity and inundation gradients. Using trait‑based ecology, interaction‑network analyses, and hierarchical Bayesian models, I quantify how invaders and consumer pressure alter productivity, nutrient cycling, soil strength, blue‑carbon storage, and community structure. I measure stability (resistance, variability, persistence) and resilience (recovery rates, hysteresis) and apply early‑warning indicators to diagnose tipping‑point risks under sea‑level rise, salinity intrusion, eutrophication, and extreme events.
