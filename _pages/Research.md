Plant Ecology
</div>

I investigate how plant communities assemble and respond to environmental change by combining large‑scale field surveys with replicated common‑garden experiments. My work integrates plant functional traits, species interactions, and global climate change. Using network and Bayesian modeling, I test how trait covariation constrains or promotes adaptation, competition, and biological invasion, and I identify key traits that predict performance and ecosystem functions (e.g., productivity and nutrient cycling). This trait‑based approach provides mechanistic predictions of species’ responses to global change and informs evidence‑based restoration and management.
