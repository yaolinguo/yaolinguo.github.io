I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the School of Renewable Natural Resources at Louisiana State University, working with Dr. Megan La Peyre and Dr. Brian Roberts (LUMCON). I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Fudan University (Shanghai, China) supervised by Prof. Rui-Ting Ju, with guidance from Prof. Bo Li. I also received doctoral training at the Plant Evolutionary Ecology Group, University of Tübingen (Germany), working with Prof. Oliver Bossdorf and Dr. Christina Richards (USF).

My research primarily focuses on plant ecology, evolution, biodiversity and biogeography, with strong interests in biological invasions, species interactions and chemical ecology. Specifically, I explore how plants respond to global change across eco-scales—from individuals to ecosystems—and how these responses differ geographically, using empirical approaches (field surveys, greenhouse experiments) with quantitative techniques (ecological modeling, machine learning and meta-analysis). At present, most of my research is based on coastal wetland ecosystems and invaded plant communities. I also actively seek scientific collaborations and aim to expand my research into diverse ecosystems across broader spatial and temporal scales.
