I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the [School of Renewable Natural Resources](https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/rnr/index.php) at Louisiana State University, working with [Dr. Megan La Peyre](https://www.lsu.edu/ceds/people/megan-peyre.php) and [Dr. Brian Roberts](https://lumcon.edu/broberts/) (LUMCON). Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Fudan University (Shanghai, China) under the mentorship of [Prof. Rui-Ting Ju](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f1/43/c30054a323907/page.htm), with additional guidance from [Prof. Bo Li](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f2/b3/c30054a324275/page.htm) and [Prof. Jihua Wu](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f0/11/c30054a323601/page.htm). I also completed part of my doctoral research in the Plant Evolutionary Ecology group at the University of Tübingen (Tübingen, Germany), under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Bossdorf](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/biologie/institute/evolution-und-oekologie/lehrbereiche/plant-evolutionary-ecology/people/oliver-bossdorf/) and in collaboration with [Dr. Christina Richards](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/ib/people/faculty/christinarichards.aspx) (USF).

My research primarily focuses on plant ecology, evolution, and biogeography. I also maintain a deep interest in biological invasions, chemical ecology, and species interactions. Specifically, I explore how plants respond to global climate change across multiple ecological scales—from individuals and populations to communities and ecosystems—and how these responses vary at broad geographic scales. To generate robust insights and uncover universal mechanisms underlying ecological and evolutionary processes, I integrate field surveys and common garden experiments for empirical validation, complemented by ecological modeling and machine learning analyses of large datasets. Currently, much of my work targets sensitive and vulnerable coastal ecosystems. I enthusiastically welcome all forms of scientific collaboration and look forward to opportunities to expand my research into diverse ecosystems and across various spatial and temporal scales.
