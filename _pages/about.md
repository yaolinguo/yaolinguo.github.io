I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the [School of Renewable Natural Resources](https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/rnr/index.php) at Louisiana State University, working with [Dr. Megan La Peyre](https://www.lsu.edu/ceds/people/megan-peyre.php). Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Fudan University under the mentorship of [Prof. Rui-Ting Ju](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f1/43/c30054a323907/page.htm), with additional guidance from [Prof. Bo Li](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f2/b3/c30054a324275/page.htm) and [Prof. Jihua Wu](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f0/11/c30054a323601/page.htm). I also completed part of my doctoral research in the Plant Evolutionary Ecology group at the University of TÃ¼bingen, under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Bossdorf](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/biologie/institute/evolution-und-oekologie/lehrbereiche/plant-evolutionary-ecology/people/oliver-bossdorf/) and in collaboration with [Dr. Christina Richards](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/ib/people/faculty/christinarichards.aspx).

My research interests span plant ecology, biological invasions, species interactions, biogeography and evolutionary biology. I am particularly intrigued by how species interactions respond to global climate change and how these dynamics vary across large geographic scales. While most of my research has been centered on coastal and terrestrial ecosystems, I hope to expand my research to other ecosystems in the future. Additionally, I have been employing ecological modeling and machine learning to analyze databases, aiming to obtain robust results that reveal universal mechanisms underlying ecological and evolutionary processes.
