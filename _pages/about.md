I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the [School of Renewable Natural Resources](https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/rnr/index.php) at Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, working with [Dr. Megan La Peyre](https://www.lsu.edu/ceds/people/megan-peyre.php) and [Dr. Brian Roberts](https://lumcon.edu/broberts/) (LUMCON). I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Fudan University (Shanghai, China) supervised by [Prof. Rui-Ting Ju](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f1/43/c30054a323907/page.htm), with guidance from [Prof. Bo Li](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f2/b3/c30054a324275/page.htm) and [Prof. Jihua Wu](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f0/11/c30054a323601/page.htm). I also received doctoral training at the Plant Evolutionary Ecology Group, University of Tübingen (Germany), working with [Prof. Oliver Bossdorf](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/biologie/institute/evolution-und-oekologie/lehrbereiche/plant-evolutionary-ecology/people/oliver-bossdorf/) and [Dr. Christina Richards](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/ib/people/faculty/christina-richards.aspx) (USF).

My research primarily focuses on plant ecology, evolution, biodiversity and biogeography, with strong interests in biological invasions, species interactions and chemical ecology. Specifically, I explore how plants respond to global change across eco-scales—from individuals to ecosystems—and how these responses differ geographically, using empirical approaches (field surveys, greenhouse experiments) with quantitative techniques (ecological modeling, machine learning and meta-analysis). I actively seek scientific collaborations and aim to expand my research into diverse ecosystems across broader spatial and temporal scales.
