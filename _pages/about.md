I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the [School of Renewable Natural Resources](https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/rnr/index.php) at Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, working with [Dr. Megan La Peyre](https://www.lsu.edu/ceds/people/megan-peyre.php) and [Dr. Brian Roberts](https://lumcon.edu/broberts/) (LUMCON). Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Fudan University (Shanghai, China) under the mentorship of [Prof. Rui-Ting Ju](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f1/43/c30054a323907/page.htm), with additional guidance from [Prof. Bo Li](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f2/b3/c30054a324275/page.htm) and [Prof. Jihua Wu](https://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/f0/11/c30054a323601/page.htm). I also completed part of my doctoral research in the Plant Evolutionary Ecology group at the University of Tübingen (Tübingen, Germany), under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Bossdorf](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/biologie/institute/evolution-und-oekologie/lehrbereiche/plant-evolutionary-ecology/people/oliver-bossdorf/) and in collaboration with [Dr. Christina Richards](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/ib/people/faculty/christinarichards.aspx) (USF).

My research primarily focuses on plant ecology, evolution, and biogeography, with strong interests in biological invasions, chemical ecology, and species interactions. Specifically, I investigate how plants respond to global climate change across eco-scales—from individuals to ecosystems—and how these responses differ geographically. To elucidate general mechanisms underlying eco- and evol-processes, I integrate empirical approaches (field surveys, greenhouse experiments) with quantitative ecological techniques (ecological modeling, machine learning, and meta-analysis). I actively seek scientific collaborations and aim to expand my research into diverse ecosystems across broader spatial and temporal scales.
