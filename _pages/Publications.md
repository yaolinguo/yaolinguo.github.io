Invasive plant species pose substantial threats to ecosystem integrity by disrupting ecosystem processes, reducing biodiversity and complicating restoration and management efforts. Non-native lineages of <em>Phragmites australis</em> are invasive in wetlands across parts of North America, causing declines in the diversity of native wetland plants and disrupting biogeochemical cycles. Despite recognition of these effects, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics, environmental drivers, and consequences for native communities of <em>Phragmites</em> expansion. Here, long-term data from the Louisiana Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS), collected from 2006 to 2023 and spanning 390 sites across nine coastal basins, were examined to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of <em>Phragmites</em> cover and expansion rates, along with associated changes in co-occurring native plant species and soil properties. Louisiana has supported non-invasive genotypes of <em>Phragmites</em> for over a century and the invasive European lineage since ~2000. However, the CRMS dataset does not distinguish among these genotypes. Thus, we analyze <em>Phragmites</em> expansion at the species-level, acknowledging that future studies distinguishing genotype-specific dynamics would be informative. <em>Phragmites</em> dynamics varied markedly among basins over the study period: <em>Phragmites</em> cover decreased in the Mississippi River Delta (initially >25%), whereas the Calcasieu-Sabine, Mermentau, Teche-Vermilion and Terrebonne basins, each starting with < 5% cover, exhibited positive expansion rates. The remaining four basins maintained low and stable <em>Phragmites</em> cover (< 5%) over the study period. In basins with positive expansion rates, <em>Phragmites</em> cover was associated with a decrease in native species cover. Overall, <em>Phragmites</em> expansion were positively associated with nutrient-rich and acidic soils and elevated salinity, highlighting key environmental factors that could inform targeted management to prevent or mitigate its expansion. The magnitude and pattern of <em>Phragmites</em> spread differed across Louisiana’s coastal basins, partially explained by differing hydrological regimes, including sediment and nutrient inputs, and water-level fluctuations. While <em>Phragmites</em> cover remains low in most basins (< 10%), ongoing expansion could disrupt native communities and critical ecosystem functions, highlighting the potential value of developing basin-specific strategies to maintain and enhance wetland resilience and ecosystem services. Our basin-level framework provides a transferable template for targeted monitoring and adaptive management of <em>Phragmites</em> in other estuarine and deltaic systems.
