Invasive plant species pose substantial threats to ecosystem integrity by disrupting ecosystem processes, reducing biodiversity and complicating restoration and management efforts. Non-native lineages of <em>Phragmites australis</em> are invasive in wetlands across parts of North America, causing declines in the diversity of native wetland plants and disrupting biogeochemical cycles. Despite recognition of these effects, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics, environmental drivers, and consequences for native communities of <em>Phragmites</em> expansion. Here, long-term data from the Louisiana Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS), collected from 2006 to 2023 and spanning 390 sites across nine coastal basins, were examined to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of <em>Phragmites</em> cover and expansion rates, along with associated changes in co-occurring native plant species and soil properties. Louisiana has supported non-invasive genotypes of <em>Phragmites</em> for over a century and the invasive European lineage since ~2000. However, the CRMS dataset does not distinguish among these genotypes. Thus, we analyze <em>Phragmites</em> expansion at the species-level, acknowledging that future studies distinguishing genotype-specific dynamics would be informative. <em>Phragmites</em> dynamics varied markedly among basins over the study period: <em>Phragmites</em> cover decreased in the Mississippi River Delta (initially >25%), whereas the Calcasieu-Sabine, Mermentau, Teche-Vermilion and Terrebonne basins, each starting with < 5% cover, exhibited positive expansion rates. The remaining four basins maintained low and stable <em>Phragmites</em> cover (< 5%) over the study period. In basins with positive expansion rates, <em>Phragmites</em> cover was associated with a decrease in native species cover. Overall, <em>Phragmites</em> expansion were positively associated with nutrient-rich and acidic soils and elevated salinity, highlighting key environmental factors that could inform targeted management to prevent or mitigate its expansion. The magnitude and pattern of <em>Phragmites</em> spread differed across Louisiana’s coastal basins, partially explained by differing hydrological regimes, including sediment and nutrient inputs, and water-level fluctuations. While <em>Phragmites</em> cover remains low in most basins (< 10%), ongoing expansion could disrupt native communities and critical ecosystem functions, highlighting the potential value of developing basin-specific strategies to maintain and enhance wetland resilience and ecosystem services. Our basin-level framework provides a transferable template for targeted monitoring and adaptive management of <em>Phragmites</em> in other estuarine and deltaic systems.

A well-established idea in plant macroecology is that the intensity of herbivory increases towards lower latitudes. However, this pattern may only be true for native plants, whereas non-native plants might not show such latitudinal cline because of their disequilibrium, and delayed coevolution, with the native herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we extracted 10,860 herbivory observations globally, and derived 709 effect sizes describing latitudinal gradients of herbivory with native and non-native plant species. We indeed found a significant overall increase in herbivory intensity at lower latitudes for native plants, but not for non-native plants. We also found that these contrasting patterns were associated with differences in climatic factors and herbivore guilds but not phylogenetic differences. Our meta-analysis confirms a fundamental difference in the macroecology of herbivory between native and non-native plants, underscoring the critical role of biogeographic context in shaping latitudinal herbivory dynamics.

Rapid evolution contributes to plant invasion success. Few studies have considered the coevolution of multidimensional traits of growth/reproduction and defense simultaneously across large geographic scales in invasive plants. We compared multiple traits related to growth, fecundity, and defense against generalist herbivores in 85 genetic families of the widespread invasive plant <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> collected from native (US, 27.70°N–34.73°N, the introduction sources for all invasive populations) and introduced (China, 20.90°N–39.04°N, the entire distribution span of invasive populations) ranges. Based on trait measures, we conducted complementary analyses including syndrome clustering, selection analysis, and testing for trait–climate relationships. Of 18 tested variables, ten revealed genetic-based differences between native and introduced ranges, and nine exhibited latitudinal clines within the introduced range. Introduced families compared to natives exhibited superior syndromes with greater growth, fecundity, and defense, which were linked to provenance climates and could enhance plant competitiveness and spread. We conclude that within only 40 years since its introduction to China, <em>Spartina</em> has evolved an integrated ecological strategy to enhance invasiveness under climate selective pressure, making it the most successful invader along China’s coast. Our study underscores the importance of considering multivariate traits to understand plant invasion success.
