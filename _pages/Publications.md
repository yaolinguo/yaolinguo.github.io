  Invasive plant species pose substantial threats to ecosystem integrity by disrupting ecosystem processes, reducing biodiversity and complicating restoration and management efforts. Non-native lineages of <em>Phragmites australis</em> are invasive in wetlands across parts of North America, causing declines in the diversity of native wetland plants and disrupting biogeochemical cycles. Despite recognition of these effects, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics, environmental drivers, and consequences for native communities of <em>Phragmites</em> expansion. Here, long-term data from the Louisiana Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS), collected from 2006 to 2023 and spanning 390 sites across nine coastal basins, were examined to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of <em>Phragmites</em> cover and expansion rates, along with associated changes in co-occurring native plant species and soil properties. Louisiana has supported non-invasive genotypes of <em>Phragmites</em> for over a century and the invasive European lineage since ~2000. However, the CRMS dataset does not distinguish among these genotypes. Thus, we analyze <em>Phragmites</em> expansion at the species-level, acknowledging that future studies distinguishing genotype-specific dynamics would be informative. <em>Phragmites</em> dynamics varied markedly among basins over the study period: <em>Phragmites</em> cover decreased in the Mississippi River Delta (initially >25%), whereas the Calcasieu-Sabine, Mermentau, Teche-Vermilion and Terrebonne basins, each starting with <5% cover, exhibited positive expansion rates. The remaining four basins maintained low and stable <em>Phragmites</em> cover (<5%) over the study period. In basins with positive expansion rates, <em>Phragmites</em> cover was associated with a decrease in native species cover. Overall, <em>Phragmites</em> expansion were positively associated with nutrient-rich and acidic soils and elevated salinity, highlighting key environmental factors that could inform targeted management to prevent or mitigate its expansion. The magnitude and pattern of <em>Phragmites</em> spread differed across Louisiana’s coastal basins, partially explained by differing hydrological regimes, including sediment and nutrient inputs, and water-level fluctuations. While <em>Phragmites</em> cover remains low in most basins (<10%), ongoing expansion could disrupt native communities and critical ecosystem functions, highlighting the potential value of developing basin-specific strategies to maintain and enhance wetland resilience and ecosystem services. Our basin-level framework provides a transferable template for targeted monitoring and adaptive management of <em>Phragmites</em> in other estuarine and deltaic systems.

    A well-established idea in plant macroecology is that the intensity of herbivory increases towards lower latitudes. However, this pattern may only be true for native plants, whereas non-native plants might not show such latitudinal cline because of their disequilibrium, and delayed coevolution, with the native herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we extracted 10,860 herbivory observations globally, and derived 709 effect sizes describing latitudinal gradients of herbivory with native and non-native plant species. We indeed found a significant overall increase in herbivory intensity at lower latitudes for native plants, but not for non-native plants. We also found that these contrasting patterns were associated with differences in climatic factors and herbivore guilds but not phylogenetic differences. Our meta-analysis confirms a fundamental difference in the macroecology of herbivory between native and non-native plants, underscoring the critical role of biogeographic context in shaping latitudinal herbivory dynamics.

    Rapid evolution contributes to plant invasion success. Few studies have considered the coevolution of multidimensional traits of growth/reproduction and defense simultaneously across large geographic scales in invasive plants. We compared multiple traits related to growth, fecundity, and defense against generalist herbivores in 85 genetic families of the widespread invasive plant <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> collected from native (US, 27.70°N–34.73°N) and introduced (China, 20.90°N–39.04°N) ranges. Based on trait measures, we conducted complementary analyses including syndrome clustering, selection analysis, and testing for trait–climate relationships. Of 18 tested variables, ten revealed genetic-based differences between native and introduced ranges, and nine exhibited latitudinal clines within the introduced range. Introduced families exhibited superior syndromes with greater growth, fecundity, and defense, which were linked to provenance climates and could enhance plant competitiveness and spread. We conclude that within only 40 years since its introduction to China, <em>Spartina</em> has evolved an integrated ecological strategy to enhance invasiveness under climate selective pressure. Our study underscores the importance of considering multivariate traits to understand plant invasion success.

    Silicon, the Earth’s second most abundant element, affects plant defenses across large geographic scales, which is an interesting yet mostly unexplored issue in non-native species. We investigated silicon-mediated variation in defensive/nutritional traits and palatability to generalist herbivores in 16 geographic populations of the invasive grass <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> collected from native and introduced ranges. We found that silicon supplementation generally increased silicon accumulation in <em>Spartina</em> leaves, enhanced their physical/chemical defenses, and reduced nutritional quality, ultimately impeding the growth of generalists. Introduced populations, independent of silicon treatments, had significantly higher silicon content in leaves than native populations. However, silicon supplementation increased more leaf silicon in low-latitude introduced populations than in high-latitude ones. Moreover, the mechanisms of silicon accumulation affecting generalists differed between provenances: enhancing chemical defenses in native populations, but improving structural or chemical defenses in introduced ones. These results suggest a rapid evolution of silicon-mediated defense strategies in introduced populations. Our findings highlight how non-native plants utilize silicon to enhance defenses and underscore the importance of metalloid defenses in invasion success.

    While successful plant invasions often occur in novel environments, invasive species usually occupy broad niches within their native and introduced ranges. A better understanding of the process of invasion therefore requires a wide sampling of ranges, and a good knowledge of introduction history. We tested for differentiation in herbivore resistance among 128 introduced (European, North American) and native (Chinese, Japanese) populations of the invasive Japanese knotweed <em>Reynoutria japonica</em> in two common gardens in the native range: one in Shanghai and the other in Yunnan. In both gardens, we found that herbivore resistance of plants from introduced populations differed from that of native populations in China but not from native populations in Japan, the putative source of introduction. Compared to native Chinese populations, plants from native Japanese populations and introduced European and North American populations had thicker leaves in both common gardens, and a lower C:N ratio but higher flavonoids content in the Shanghai garden. Variation in herbivore resistance was more strongly associated with climate of collecting sites for populations from the native range than for those from introduced ranges. Our results support the hypothesis that introduction of particularly resistant plants from Japan may have played a key role in driving biogeographic variation in herbivore resistance. Our study highlights the importance of understanding introduction history to interpret the biogeographic divergence of global plant invaders.

    The competitor, stress tolerator, and ruderal strategy (CSR) framework has been widely applied to explain ecological processes across species. However, its utility in revealing intra-specific trade-offs and genetic adaptation to climate remains unclear. In this study, we examined whether the CSR strategy estimated by leaf traits can identify adaptations to climate in the common reed <em>Phragmites australis</em>. For this purpose, we integrated functional trait data from field surveys and a three-year common garden experiment to compare CSR scores between two typical populations of <em>P. australis</em> from western and eastern China. We further assessed the associations of CSR scores with latitude, bioclimatic factors, and phylogeographical sources using a global dataset including two invaded lineages in North America. We found that competitor scores were positively correlated with latitude, whereas stress tolerator scores were negatively correlated. Competitor scores were positively correlated with bioclimatic factors, even when controlling for phylogeny. All CSR scores displayed significant phylogenetic signals, with the invasive lineage in the higher latitudes (haplotype M) exhibiting higher stress tolerator scores than the native lineage. Differences in competitor and stress tolerator scores between western and eastern Chinese populations of <em>P. australis</em> were consistent across field and common garden experiments. Although intra-species variation in CSR strategy may be influenced by phylogenetic history, our finding that CSR strategy in <em>P. australis</em> populations is correlated with latitude suggests these plants have adapted to local climates along a latitudinal gradient.

    Wetlands are crucial ecosystems that provide a wide range of ecological services, such as water purification, flood control, and carbon sequestration, where the diversity of wetland plants is fundamental to maintaining these functions. <em>Phragmites australis</em> is a globally widespread wetland grass with a high genetic diversity, exhibiting strong intraspecific variation across environmental gradients. While both phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation are recognized drivers of plant adaptation, their relative importance in mediating the growth and decomposition traits of wetland plants remains debated. Here, we surveyed the growth and litter traits of two lineages (haplotypes) of <em>P. australis</em> in two common gardens in eastern China. The leaf litter of <em>P. australis</em> was also collected from the field in two provinces where the two common gardens are located. Microcosm experiments were carried out to explore the litter decomposition ability. We found that the common garden (growth environment) significantly affected the growth performance (shoot diameter and height), leaf litter stoichiometric traits (contents of N and P), and the leaf decomposition over 180 days. The N content in the leaf litter from the higher-latitude province of Liaoning was greater than that from the lower-latitude province of Shandong, regardless of whether it was collected from the field or the common garden. The litter N and P contents were the key factors affecting the decomposition during the 180-day experiment. However, we did not find the effects of lineage (genetic variation) on the variation of these traits. The climatic factors of the genotype origin were significantly correlated with the growth traits but not the litter traits or decomposition rates. The findings indicate that <em>P. australis</em> in eastern temperate China primarily adapts through phenotypic plasticity rather than genetic variation, which is crucial for wetland resilience in a changing climate. This study underscores the pivotal role of environmental factors and phenotypic plasticity in <em>P. australis</em> growth and decomposition, suggesting that conservation efforts should prioritize the local environment over genetic variation for effective wetland management.
