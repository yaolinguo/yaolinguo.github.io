  Invasive plant species pose substantial threats to ecosystem integrity by disrupting ecosystem processes, reducing biodiversity and complicating restoration and management efforts. Non-native lineages of <em>Phragmites australis</em> are invasive in wetlands across parts of North America, causing declines in the diversity of native wetland plants and disrupting biogeochemical cycles. Despite recognition of these effects, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics, environmental drivers, and consequences for native communities of <em>Phragmites</em> expansion. Here, long-term data from the Louisiana Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS), collected from 2006 to 2023 and spanning 390 sites across nine coastal basins, were examined to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of <em>Phragmites</em> cover and expansion rates, along with associated changes in co-occurring native plant species and soil properties. Louisiana has supported non-invasive genotypes of <em>Phragmites</em> for over a century and the invasive European lineage since ~2000. However, the CRMS dataset does not distinguish among these genotypes. Thus, we analyze <em>Phragmites</em> expansion at the species-level, acknowledging that future studies distinguishing genotype-specific dynamics would be informative. <em>Phragmites</em> dynamics varied markedly among basins over the study period: <em>Phragmites</em> cover decreased in the Mississippi River Delta (initially >25%), whereas the Calcasieu-Sabine, Mermentau, Teche-Vermilion and Terrebonne basins, each starting with <5% cover, exhibited positive expansion rates. The remaining four basins maintained low and stable <em>Phragmites</em> cover (<5%) over the study period. In basins with positive expansion rates, <em>Phragmites</em> cover was associated with a decrease in native species cover. Overall, <em>Phragmites</em> expansion were positively associated with nutrient-rich and acidic soils and elevated salinity, highlighting key environmental factors that could inform targeted management to prevent or mitigate its expansion. The magnitude and pattern of <em>Phragmites</em> spread differed across Louisiana’s coastal basins, partially explained by differing hydrological regimes, including sediment and nutrient inputs, and water-level fluctuations. While <em>Phragmites</em> cover remains low in most basins (<10%), ongoing expansion could disrupt native communities and critical ecosystem functions, highlighting the potential value of developing basin-specific strategies to maintain and enhance wetland resilience and ecosystem services. Our basin-level framework provides a transferable template for targeted monitoring and adaptive management of <em>Phragmites</em> in other estuarine and deltaic systems.

    A well-established idea in plant macroecology is that the intensity of herbivory increases towards lower latitudes. However, this pattern may only be true for native plants, whereas non-native plants might not show such latitudinal cline because of their disequilibrium, and delayed coevolution, with the native herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we extracted 10,860 herbivory observations globally, and derived 709 effect sizes describing latitudinal gradients of herbivory with native and non-native plant species. We indeed found a significant overall increase in herbivory intensity at lower latitudes for native plants, but not for non-native plants. We also found that these contrasting patterns were associated with differences in climatic factors and herbivore guilds but not phylogenetic differences. Our meta-analysis confirms a fundamental difference in the macroecology of herbivory between native and non-native plants, underscoring the critical role of biogeographic context in shaping latitudinal herbivory dynamics.

    Rapid evolution contributes to plant invasion success. Few studies have considered the coevolution of multidimensional traits of growth/reproduction and defense simultaneously across large geographic scales in invasive plants. We compared multiple traits related to growth, fecundity, and defense against generalist herbivores in 85 genetic families of the widespread invasive plant <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> collected from native (US, 27.70°N–34.73°N) and introduced (China, 20.90°N–39.04°N) ranges. Based on trait measures, we conducted complementary analyses including syndrome clustering, selection analysis, and testing for trait–climate relationships. Of 18 tested variables, ten revealed genetic-based differences between native and introduced ranges, and nine exhibited latitudinal clines within the introduced range. Introduced families exhibited superior syndromes with greater growth, fecundity, and defense, which were linked to provenance climates and could enhance plant competitiveness and spread. We conclude that within only 40 years since its introduction to China, <em>Spartina</em> has evolved an integrated ecological strategy to enhance invasiveness under climate selective pressure. Our study underscores the importance of considering multivariate traits to understand plant invasion success.

    Silicon, the Earth’s second most abundant element, affects plant defenses across large geographic scales, which is an interesting yet mostly unexplored issue in non-native species. We investigated silicon-mediated variation in defensive/nutritional traits and palatability to generalist herbivores in 16 geographic populations of the invasive grass <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> collected from native and introduced ranges. We found that silicon supplementation generally increased silicon accumulation in <em>Spartina</em> leaves, enhanced their physical/chemical defenses, and reduced nutritional quality, ultimately impeding the growth of generalists. Introduced populations, independent of silicon treatments, had significantly higher silicon content in leaves than native populations. However, silicon supplementation increased more leaf silicon in low-latitude introduced populations than in high-latitude ones. Moreover, the mechanisms of silicon accumulation affecting generalists differed between provenances: enhancing chemical defenses in native populations, but improving structural or chemical defenses in introduced ones. These results suggest a rapid evolution of silicon-mediated defense strategies in introduced populations. Our findings highlight how non-native plants utilize silicon to enhance defenses and underscore the importance of metalloid defenses in invasion success.

    While successful plant invasions often occur in novel environments, invasive species usually occupy broad niches within their native and introduced ranges. A better understanding of the process of invasion therefore requires a wide sampling of ranges, and a good knowledge of introduction history. We tested for differentiation in herbivore resistance among 128 introduced (European, North American) and native (Chinese, Japanese) populations of the invasive Japanese knotweed <em>Reynoutria japonica</em> in two common gardens in the native range: one in Shanghai and the other in Yunnan. In both gardens, we found that herbivore resistance of plants from introduced populations differed from that of native populations in China but not from native populations in Japan, the putative source of introduction. Compared to native Chinese populations, plants from native Japanese populations and introduced European and North American populations had thicker leaves in both common gardens, and a lower C:N ratio but higher flavonoids content in the Shanghai garden. Variation in herbivore resistance was more strongly associated with climate of collecting sites for populations from the native range than for those from introduced ranges. Our results support the hypothesis that introduction of particularly resistant plants from Japan may have played a key role in driving biogeographic variation in herbivore resistance. Our study highlights the importance of understanding introduction history to interpret the biogeographic divergence of global plant invaders.

    The competitor, stress tolerator, and ruderal strategy (CSR) framework has been widely applied to explain ecological processes across species. However, its utility in revealing intra-specific trade-offs and genetic adaptation to climate remains unclear. In this study, we examined whether the CSR strategy estimated by leaf traits can identify adaptations to climate in the common reed <em>Phragmites australis</em>. For this purpose, we integrated functional trait data from field surveys and a three-year common garden experiment to compare CSR scores between two typical populations of <em>P. australis</em> from western and eastern China. We further assessed the associations of CSR scores with latitude, bioclimatic factors, and phylogeographical sources using a global dataset including two invaded lineages in North America. We found that competitor scores were positively correlated with latitude, whereas stress tolerator scores were negatively correlated. Competitor scores were positively correlated with bioclimatic factors, even when controlling for phylogeny. All CSR scores displayed significant phylogenetic signals, with the invasive lineage in the higher latitudes (haplotype M) exhibiting higher stress tolerator scores than the native lineage. Differences in competitor and stress tolerator scores between western and eastern Chinese populations of <em>P. australis</em> were consistent across field and common garden experiments. Although intra-species variation in CSR strategy may be influenced by phylogenetic history, our finding that CSR strategy in <em>P. australis</em> populations is correlated with latitude suggests these plants have adapted to local climates along a latitudinal gradient.

    Wetlands are vital ecosystems that provide diverse ecological services, including water purification, flood regulation, and carbon sequestration. The diversity and adaptability of wetland plant species underpin these functions. <em>Phragmites australis</em>, a globally widespread wetland grass, exhibits strong intraspecific variation across environmental gradients. While both phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation are known to drive plant adaptation, their relative importance in mediating growth and litter decomposition remains debated. Here, we examined growth and litter traits in two haplotypes of <em>P. australis</em> using common garden experiments and field sampling in eastern China. Leaf litter was collected from two provinces and used in microcosm decomposition experiments. Growth environment (common garden) significantly influenced shoot size, stoichiometric traits (leaf N and P), and decomposition rates. Leaf litter from the higher-latitude Liaoning province had higher nitrogen content than that from the lower-latitude Shandong province. Litter N and P concentrations were the main drivers of decomposition across 180 days. However, we found no significant effect of genetic lineage on these traits. While genotype origin climate correlated with growth traits, it did not influence decomposition-related variables. These findings suggest that phenotypic plasticity, rather than genetic differentiation, is the primary mechanism enabling <em>P. australis</em> to adapt to variable environments in eastern China—highlighting the importance of local conditions over genotype in wetland management and resilience planning.

    Within-species genetic diversity is shaped by multiple evolutionary forces within the confines of geography, and has cascading effects on the biodiversity of other taxa and levels. Invasive species are often initially limited in genetic diversity but still respond rapidly to their new range, possibly through ‘pre-adapted’ genotypes or multiple sources of genetic diversity, but little is known about how their genetic structure differs from that of native species and how it alters the genetic-species diversity relationship. Here, we selected a widespread native species <em>Phragmites australis</em> and its co-occurring invasive competitor <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> as our model plant species. We investigated the genetic structure of <em>P. australis</em> using two chloroplast fragments and ten nuclear microsatellites in 13 populations along the Chinese coastal wetlands. We discovered a distinct geographical differentiation, showing that the northern and southern populations harbored unique genotypes. We also found a significant increase in genetic diversity (allelic richness and expected heterozygosity) from south to north. Combined with previous studies of <em>S. alterniflora</em>, the Mantel tests revealed a significant correlation of genetic distances between <em>P. australis</em> and <em>S. alterniflora</em> even when controlling for geographic distance, suggesting that the invasive species <em>S. alterniflora</em> might exhibit a phylogeographic pattern similar to that of the native species to some extent. Furthermore, our results suggest that the <em>S. alterniflora</em> invasion has altered the relationship between the genetic diversity of the dominant native plant and the associated species richness of soil nematodes. The reason for the alteration of genetic-species diversity relationship might be that the biological invasion weakens the environmental impact on both levels of biodiversity. Our findings contribute to understanding the latitudinal patterns of intraspecific genetic diversity in widespread species. This work on the genetic diversity analysis of native species also provides significant implications for the invasion stage and ecological consequences of biological invasions.

    The spatial pattern of leaf stoichiometry is critical in predicting plant palatability and ecosystem productivity and nutrient cycling rates and thus is a major focus of community ecological research. Coastal wetlands as vital blue carbon ecosystems, with high possibility to be vulnerable to plant invasion, studies focused on stoichiometry and its pattern are important to unveil the elements cycling process. However, previous studies have mainly focused on stoichiometry in terrestrial ecosystems, there are few studies conducted on coastal wetland ecosystems, especially the studies that compare leaf stoichiometry between native and non-native plants in coastal wetlands. In this study, we compared the latitudinal patterns of leaf nutrient contents and their stoichiometric ratios between native and non-native plant species across coastal wetland ecosystems and investigated whether leaf stoichiometric patterns were driven by climatic factors. We used a compiled global data set of 954 records to conduct a systematic meta-analysis. The results showed that there were significant differences in latitudinal patterns of leaf carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents and C:N ratio between native and non-native species, as well as significant differences in leaf C, N, and phosphorus (P) contents. For native species, we found significant latitudinal patterns in leaf C, N, and P contents and C:N and C:P ratios, whereas for non-native species, we found significant latitudinal patterns in leaf N content and C:P and N:P ratios. Mean annual temperature of the data collection site was a significant predictor of leaf stoichiometry of native plants but only of leaf N content and C:P ratio of non-native plants. Thus, we demonstrated spatial heterogeneity in leaf stoichiometries between native and non-native plants in coastal wetlands, indicating that such differences should be emphasized in future biogeochemical models and plant-herbivore interaction studies owing to the important role of wetland plants in global C, N, and P cycles. Our findings increase understanding of plant-related nutrient and elements cycling in coastal wetlands, as well as improve predictions of plant growth rates and vegetation productivity across large scales under plant invasion scenarios.

    Invasive alien species are primary drivers of biodiversity loss and species extinction. Smooth cordgrass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>) is one of the most aggressive invasive plants in coastal ecosystems around the world. However, the genomic bases and evolutionary mechanisms underlying its invasion success have remained largely unknown. Here, we assembled a chromosome-level reference genome and performed phenotypic and population genomic analyses between native US and introduced Chinese populations. Our phenotypic comparisons showed that introduced Chinese populations have evolved competitive traits, such as early flowering time and greater plant biomass, during secondary introductions along China’s coast. Population genomic and transcriptomic inferences revealed distinct evolutionary trajectories of low- and high-latitude Chinese populations. In particular, genetic mixture among different source populations, together with independent natural selection acting on distinct target genes, may have resulted in high genome dynamics of the introduced Chinese populations. Our study provides novel phenotypic and genomic evidence showing how <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> rapidly adapts to variable environmental conditions in its introduced ranges. Moreover, candidate genes related to flowering time, fast growth, and stress tolerance (i.e., salinity and submergence) provide valuable genetic resources for future improvement of cereal crops.

    Plant invasions profoundly impact both natural and managed ecosystems, and removal of the invasive plants addresses only part of the problem of restoring impacted areas. The rehabilitation of diverse communities and their ecosystem functions following removal of invasive plants is an important goal of ecological restoration. Arthropod assemblages and trophic interactions are important indicators of the success of restoration, but they have largely been overlooked in saltmarshes. We determined how arthropod assemblages and trophic interactions changed with the invasion of the exotic plant <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> and with the restoration of the native plant <em>Phragmites australis</em> following <em>Spartina</em> removal in a Chinese saltmarsh. We investigated multiple biotic and abiotic variables to gain insight into the factors underlying the changes in arthropod assemblages and trophic structure. We found that although <em>Spartina</em> invasion had changed arthropod diversity, community structure, feeding-guild composition, and the diets of arthropod natural enemies in the saltmarsh, these changes could be reversed by the restoration of native <em>Phragmites</em> vegetation. The variation in arthropod assemblages and trophic structure were critically associated with four biotic and abiotic variables (aboveground biomass, plant density, leaf N, and soil salinity). Our findings demonstrate the positive effects of controlling invasive plants on biodiversity and nutrient cycling and provide a foundation for assessing the efficacy of ecological restoration projects in saltmarshes.

    Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment due to anthropogenic activities can significantly affect soil N transformations in forest ecosystems. However, the effects of N and P additions on nitrification and denitrification processes in <em>Metasequoia glyptostroboides</em> plantations, an economically important forest type in China, remain poorly understood. This study investigated the responses of soil nitrification and denitrification rates, as well as the abundances of nitrifiers and denitrifiers, to different levels of N and P additions in a 6-year nutrient addition experiment in a <em>M. glyptostroboides</em> plantation. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify the main predictors of nitrification and denitrification rates. The results showed that moderate N addition stimulated nitrification rates and abundances of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), while excessive N and P additions inhibited denitrification rates and reduced the abundance of <em>nirS</em>-type denitrifiers. AOB abundance was the main predictor of nitrification rates under N additions, whereas microbial biomass carbon and <em>nirS</em> gene abundance were key factors controlling denitrification rates. Under P additions, tree growth parameters and AOB abundance were the primary predictors of nitrification and denitrification rates. Our study reveals complex interactions among nutrient inputs, plant growth, soil properties, and microbial communities in regulating soil N transformations in plantation forests, and offers valuable insights for nutrient management to enhance ecosystem function and health of <em>M. glyptostroboides</em> plantations under future nutrient deposition scenarios.

    Cadmium (Cd) pollution poses a significant threat to wetland ecosystems. <em>Phragmites australis</em>, a species with intraspecific ploidy diversity, is commonly used in constructed wetlands for pollution remediation. However, little is known about how the ploidy variation of <em>P. australis</em> influences the phytoremediation processes via physiological and rhizosphere regulations. Here, we used <em>P. australis</em> from two major lineages in China (i.e., tetraploid lineage O and octoploid lineage P) and applied three Cd treatments (control, low Cd concentration, and high Cd concentration). We found that the lineage O had a bioconcentration factor of Cd approximately 40% higher than that of the lineage P. The translocation factor of the lineage P was about 300% higher than that of the lineage O. These suggest that the lower ploidy lineage exhibited a greater capacity to absorb Cd from the environment into the underground part compared to the higher ploidy lineage, and the higher ploidy lineage demonstrated a superior ability in transferring Cd from the underground to the aboveground part. The advanced transpiration system in the higher ploidy lineage can contribute to its enhanced ability to translocate Cd, as the translocation factor of Cd was significantly correlated with the base shoot diameter and the transpiration rate, both notably higher in the lineage P. The rhizobacterial community associated with the lineage P displayed a more intense response to Cd, characterized by an increase in both the diversity of the community and the number of varied bacterial functions following the addition of Cd. Our study offers profound insights into the ecological consequences of intraspecific polyploidization and the application of intraspecific ploidy variation in environmental management and wetland restoration.

    Like alien plant invasion, range expansion of native plants may threaten biodiversity and economies, rendering them native invaders. Variation in abiotic and biotic conditions across a large geographic scale greatly affects variation in traits and interactions with herbivores of native plant invaders, which is an interesting yet mostly unexplored issue. We used a common garden experiment to compare defensive/nutritional traits and palatability to generalist herbivores of 20 native (23.64° N–30.18° N) and introduced range (31.58° N–36.87° N) populations of <em>Reynoutria japonica</em>, which is a native invader following range expansion in China. We analyzed the relationships among herbivore pressure, climate, plant chloroplast haplotypes, leaf traits, and herbivore performance. Of the 16 variables tested, we observed range differences in 11 variables and latitudinal clines in nine variables. In general, herbivores performed better on the introduced plants than on the native plants, and better on the high-latitude plants than on the low-latitude plants within the introduced populations. Three key traits (leaf thickness, specific leaf area, and carbon-to-nitrogen [C:N] ratio) determined palatability to herbivores and were significantly associated with temperature and/or precipitation of plant provenance as well as with plant haplotypes but not with herbivore pressure. Our results revealed a causal sequence from plant-range-based environmental forces and genetic context to plant quality and palatability to herbivores in <em>R. japonica</em>. These findings suggest a post-introduction evolution of <em>R. japonica</em>, which may partly explain the colonization success of this important native, but invasive plant.

    Latitudinal variation in biotic interactions is recognized as a driver underlying variation in plant invasion success and therefore an important issue in conservation biogeography. However, previous studies have mainly focused on interactions between living plants and herbivores, whereas litter traits and detritivory have been hardly studied along latitude or compared between native and invasive plants. Our aim was to compare latitudinal variation in leaf litter chemistry and palatability to detritivores between invasive and native plants, and investigate which chemical traits determine detritivory and whether they are climate-driven. We combined field surveys with laboratory experiments to compare latitudinal variation in litter chemistry between the widespread invasive <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> and its native competitor <em>Phragmites australis</em> across their co-occurring range (~2200 km). For both species, we examined litter palatability to two common detritivores (<em>Porcellio laevis</em> and <em>Chiromantes dehaani</em>) along the same latitude. We also analysed relationships among climate, litter traits, and detritivory. In five of nine litter traits, we found latitudinal clines, with little difference between the two plant species in how they responded across the gradient. Litter palatability decreased with increasing latitude, but was generally higher in <em>Spartina</em> than <em>Phragmites</em>. Two key litter traits (C:P ratio and flavonoid content) were significantly associated with temperature of origin and with detritivory. There were geographic clines in litter traits and palatability, with strong links between climate, litter chemistry and detritivory, in both <em>Spartina</em> and <em>Phragmites</em>. <em>Spartina</em> litter, however, was more rapidly decomposed by detritivores, which could create positive feedbacks, and contributes to the successful <em>Spartina</em> invasion along China's coast. Future ecological restoration projects should therefore dispose <em>Spartina</em> plant tissue or litter off-site, to reduce the competitiveness of <em>Spartina</em> and support the conservation of native <em>Phragmites</em>.
